# Multivariate-Time-Series-Forecasting
This is the Repository for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting.The objective of case study is to compare various models with minimal feature engineering techniques.

Time series data is a series of data points measured at consistent time intervals which may be hourly, daily, weekly, every 10 days, and so on. In a time series data, each data point in the series depends on the previous data points.

In multivariate, Time-Series data, multiple variables will be varying over time. Each variable depends not only on its past values but also has some dependency on other variables. This dependency is used for forecasting future values. In univariate, Only one variable is varying over time.

Here we will address the problem using Classical Linear Models, Tree based algorithms, Ensemble Methods and Neural Network based Methods.
